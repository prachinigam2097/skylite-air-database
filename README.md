# ✈SkyLite Air Database Management Project

A comprehensive database management solution for **SkyLite Air**, designed to improve **route profitability, fleet utilisation, and operational efficiency** through structured data modelling, SQL analysis, and business insights.

---

## Project Overview
- Designed and implemented a **relational database (SQLite)** capturing flight, route, cost, and transaction data for SkyLite Air.
- Analysed **138K+ transactions** to generate insights on **revenue, peak travel days, aircraft utilisation, and route demand**.
- Produced **data‑driven recommendations** to optimise flight scheduling, reallocate underused aircraft, and improve pricing strategies.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Database:** SQLite  
- **Languages:** SQL, Python  
- **Tools:** Mockaroo (synthetic data), Pandas  
- **Concepts:** ERD Design, Normalisation (1NF–3NF), Data Validation

---

## Key Features
 **ERD & Schema Design** – Built a 6‑entity schema (Flights, Routes, Aircraft, Airports, Costs, Transactions) using Crow’s Foot notation.  
 **SQL Queries for Insights** – Generated KPIs such as seat occupancy, peak travel days, and route profitability.  
 **Synthetic Data Generation** – Populated database with realistic flight, cost, and booking data (138K+ records).  
 **Actionable Recommendations** – Proposed aircraft reassignment and pricing strategies to improve margins.

---

## Business Impact
- Identified **£78M revenue** vs **£22M costs** across 500 flights/month.  
- Highlighted **Tokyo, Barcelona & Paris** as key high‑demand routes.  
- Improved utilisation of A380 and A320 aircraft through **data‑led reallocation**.

## Future Improvements
- Add Tableau/Power BI dashboards for live visual reporting.  
- Integrate real airline data for deeper trend analysis.  
- Build API endpoints for automated reporting.
